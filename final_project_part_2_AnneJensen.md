[*For some, the experience of Allegheny County is something like this: entering Pittsburgh through one of its famed bridges. For others, the reality looks a little different.*]

### Although air quality in Allegheny County has improved over the decades, it remains harmful to many populations

### These effects are felt most heavily by poor and minority communities

Allegheny County contains environmental justice communities, which are defined as "any census tract where 20 percent or more individuals live at or below the federal poverty line, and/or 30 percent or more of the population identifies as a non-white minority, based on data from the U.S. Census Bureau and the federal guidelines for poverty." [(Source)](https://www.dep.pa.gov/PublicParticipation/OfficeofEnvironmentalJustice/Pages/PA-Environmental-Justice-Areas.aspx)

### In particular, the Mon Valley region of Allegheny County experiences high levels of poverty combined with a heavy concentration of air pollution 
Data collected by the Allegheny County Health Department shows that the air pollution monitor located in Liberty frequently detects unhealthy levels of fine particulate matter (PM2.5).

#### In addition, 4 of the top 10 industrial polluters in Allegheny County are located in the Mon Valley
[*Note: The final visualization will highlight the four facilties located in the Mon Valley.*]

### Call to Action
1. [Monitor and report air quality.](https://smellpgh.org/)
2. Join local advocate organizations, like [Allegheny County Clean Air Now.](https://accan.org/)
3. Attend an [Allegheny County Board of Health Public Meeting](https://www.alleghenycounty.us/Health-Department/Resources/About/Board-of-Health/Public-Meeting-Schedule.aspx) and request action.

## User Research

### Results From User Research
In general, I was not surprised by the user feedback that I received from my project. My users are not originally from Allegheny County, and so were largely unaware of the areas struggles with air pollution and environmental justice as a whole. I received some good points about the sequence of my project and where to add more information, particularly in terms of emphasizing where pollution comes from, what the major types of pollution are, and framing the narrative in terms of the real people suffering the effects of air pollution. I also only received negative feedback about the visualizations and datasets that I did not personally create.

### Next Steps
One of the things I struggled with while completing this draft was focusing my project for my intended audience, Mon Valley residents looking to create change in their community. The feedback I received during my user research indicates that my narrative may be too high-level for general understanding, and I'm still not sure how to change that. I also feel like there are some loose threads in my narrative, and that the shift to the call to action after discussing the Mon Valley in-depth feels abrupt. Any instructor feedback would be greatly appreciated here. 

In terms of visualizations, I plan to add a few more that incorporate the user research feedback I received and to tweak the visualizations I've already created so that they properly emphasis the data I want highlighted.
