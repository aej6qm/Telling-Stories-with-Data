# Draft Storyboard: Air Pollution Concentration in Allegheny County
## Allegheny County has a long history of unhealthy air pollution, the effects of which are felt most heavily by poor and minority communities.
[*Discuss [recent study](https://www.ehn.org/environmental-injustice-pittsburgh-air-pollution-2646169635/particle-1) published in "Environmental Health" by researchers from the University of Pittsburgh, Carnegie Mellon University, and the Allegheny County Health Department*] 

## Although air quality in Allegheny County has improved over the decades, it remains harmful to many populations

In the study, researchers estimated that about 40 percent of air pollution-related coronary heart disease deaths in Allegheny County occur in environmental justice communitiesâ€”even though such communities represent just 27 percent of the county's total population.

Environmental Justice Communities are defined by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection as "any census tract where 20 percent or more individuals live at or below the federal poverty line, and/or 30 percent or more of the population identifies as a non-white minority, based on data from the U.S. Census Bureau and the federal guidelines for poverty" [(Source)](https://www.dep.pa.gov/PublicParticipation/OfficeofEnvironmentalJustice/Pages/PA-Environmental-Justice-Areas.aspx)

## Data collected by the Allegheny County Health Department shows that the air pollution monitor located in Liberty frequently detects unhealthy levels of fine particulate matter (PM2.5).

The location of this monitor is bordered by Clairton, which is home to the third worst polluter in Allegheny County, Clairton Coke Works. [Source](https://toxicten.org/)
