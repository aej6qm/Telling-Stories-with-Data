[*For some, the experience of Allegheny County is something like this: entering Pittsburgh through one of its famed bridges. For others, the reality looks a little different.*]

### Although air quality in Allegheny County has improved over the decades, it remains harmful to many populations.

## These effects are felt most heavily by poor and minority communities

Allegheny County contains environmental justice communities, which are defined as "any census tract where 20 percent or more individuals live at or below the federal poverty line, and/or 30 percent or more of the population identifies as a non-white minority, based on data from the U.S. Census Bureau and the federal guidelines for poverty." [(Source)](https://www.dep.pa.gov/PublicParticipation/OfficeofEnvironmentalJustice/Pages/PA-Environmental-Justice-Areas.aspx)

## In particular, the Mon Valley region of Allegheny County experiences high levels of poverty combined with a heavy concentration of air pollution 
Data collected by the Allegheny County Health Department shows that the air pollution monitor located in Liberty frequently detects unhealthy levels of fine particulate matter (PM2.5).

### In addition, four of the top ten industrial polluters in Allegheny County are located in the Mon Valley
