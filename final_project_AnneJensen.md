# Outline
For my final project, I will be discussing air quality in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania. Specifically, I will be telling a story about reality that air pollution in Allegheny County is concentrated in minority areas and implement a call to action for concerned residents and activist groups.

My project structure will include the classic elements of any good story- setup, conflict, and resolution. My setup will include an introduction in which I introduce my topic, air quality in Allegheny County, and briefly touch on the historical policy decisions that created the situation. Then, I will call attention to the conflict for my audience through visualizations demonstrating specific data about air quality in predominately white areas versus Black areas of Allegheny County, among other measures. After, I will recap that this air quality problem has existed for many decades, and that air pollution has had a demonstrated effect on health for affected communities (more data and visualizations). Finally, I will end with a resolution calling on my audience to organize for change and equity in the environment.

# Data
My data sources...

I plan to use this data to create my visualizations, which I sketched out above. I plan to focus using data that can show the problem I'm describing (the higher rates of air pollution experienced by Black communities compared to white communities) and the results of this problem (the increased likelihood of illness that comes from long-term exposure to air pollution).

My data sources can be found here and here.

# Method and Medium
My final project will most likely be completed using Shorthand, since this platform seems particularly clean and effective to build a story like this. I would also consider using Esri's Story Maps, as this is another digital platform that would lend itself well to geographic storytelling. Most importantly, neither potential medium will result in a deliverable that requires Powerpoint slides or a pitch deck.
