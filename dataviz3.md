# Step One: Find a Data Visualization
![EPA Climate Change Indicator](https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2021-03/leaf-bloom-dates_download1_2021.png)

I selected this data visualization because I have a particular interest in climate change and the data used to communicate its effects. As a future policy-maker, climate data is critical to present in an understandable, accessible way. Climate change involves a series of risks to human health and safety, and comprehending those risks is essential to making informed decisions about environmental policy. This is especially true for a government website looking to convey data about indicators for climate change that can be used by decision-makers. Because this data visualization is fairly cluttered and convoluted, I thought it would be a good candidate for critique and revision. Most importantly, the data is publicly accessible for such work.

# Step Two: Critique the Data Visualization
For my critique, I used the method provided in the Google Form to address the usefulness, completeness, perceptibility, truthfulness, intuitiveness, aesthetics, and engagement of the original visualization. Although not an inherently inaccurate or unreliable visualization, this graph lost points for imperceptibility and poor visual aesthetics, as its many lines and the use of the same color for those lines based on category distracted from the overall understanding and intuitiveness of the information presented. The inclusion of additional, unnecessary elements, including gridlines, over-involved legend information, and clarifying “Later” and “Earlier” arrows simultaneously add too much unnecessary information and attempt to clarify the elements of an not entirely effective graph. Its cluttered visual elements and lack of perceptibility make it a less than engaging visualization, as it would be unlikely to be shared or inspire further study from the audience. 

According to the EPA website, the data presented in this visualization and others like it are intended for anyone from scientists to policymakers to the general public. Essentially, anyone interested in or working with climate change could find this data useful, necessitating an effective and understandable visualization. 

# Step Three: Wireframe a Solution

My redesign of the original visualization is imagined by the wireframe above created using Balsamiq; although the trendlines presented in the graph above are just a stock image, the usefulness of this technique comes from its general layout. Here, I removed the gridlines, simplified the trendlines (theoretically), reduced the wordiness of the legend, and removed the additional arrows. I also revised the title to better reflect the information presented in the visualization. I kept the chart type a line graph, as I still think that this is the most effective way of displaying the data graphically since the trendlines more vividly deviate from the mean in this context.

# Step Four: Test the Solution
After constructing my wireframe, I selected two people to evaluate my revised visualization. I asked the following questions to conduct my interviews:
1. Can you describe to me what this is, and what it’s telling you?
2. Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?
3. Who do you think is the intended audience for this?
4. Is there anything you would change or do differently?

I received the answers below during my user research:
1. Can you describe to me what this is, and what it’s telling you?
* It’s showing a general upward trend.
* Looks like it’s showing the dates between first leaf and first bloom over 30 years.
2. Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?
* Data lines are not representative of the original.
* Not particularly; revised layout will look cleaner and color scheme makes sense.
3. Who do you think is the intended audience for this?
* People interested in horticulture and climate change
* Environmentalists of some kind
4. Is there anything you would change or do differently?
* No, just put in correct data and colors.
* Lilac and honeysuckle are not necessary in the title- just say “common seasonal plants”; include the source.

The primary feedback I received was that it was confusing that my wireframe included only stock data and not the actual data from the original graph. I found myself toggling between the two to explain the underlying data, which was less than ideal. My title was also somewhat confusing when combined with the lack of specific data. Despite this, I received good feedback on my layout. The intended audience is clear (those interested in environmental data), and my proposed changes to the visualization were well-received. Based on these insights, I revised the title to better reflect the trends in the data and moved forward with the layout outlined in my wireframe.

## Summary
In general, I think that my data visualization did a good job of presenting the original data in a more intuitive and perceptible way. The aesthetics of my graph make the information easily understood and should encourage greater interaction and interest in the topic of climate change and its effects on our world. I think that while my visualization is an improvement, it would interesting to experiment with out chart types or compare multiple indicators within
