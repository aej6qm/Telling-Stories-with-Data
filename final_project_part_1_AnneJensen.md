# Outline
For my final project, I will be discussing air quality in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania. Specifically, I will be telling a story about the reality that air pollution in Allegheny County is concentrated in minority areas and implement a call to action for concerned residents and activist groups.

My project structure will include the classic elements of any good story- setup, conflict, and resolution. My setup will include an introduction in which I introduce my topic, air quality in Allegheny County, and briefly touch on the historical policy decisions that created the situation. Then, I will call attention to the conflict for my audience through visualizations demonstrating specific data about air quality in predominately white areas versus Black areas of Allegheny County, among other measures. After, I will recap to emphasize that this air quality problem has existed for many decades, and that air pollution has had a demonstrated effect on health for affected communities (more data and visualizations). Finally, I will resolve my story by calling on my audience to organize for change and equity in the environment.

## Air Pollution in Allegheny County is Concentrated in Minority Areas; Air Pollution Causes Negative Health Effects

# Data
My data will come from a variety of sources, including the Western Pennsylvania Regional Data Ceter (WPRDC), the United states Census Bureau, and the World Health Organization (WHO). I intend to use this data to create my visualizations, which I sketched out above. I will focus on using data that can show the problem I'm describing (the higher rates of air pollution experienced by Black communities compared to white communities) and the results of this problem (the increased likelihood of illness that comes from long-term exposure to air pollution).

[Census Bureau data](https://data.census.gov/cedsci/profile?g=0500000US42003) will inform my understanding of the geographic locations of predominately white and Black areas of Allegheny County, while the [WPRDC data](https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/allegheny-county-air-quality) will allow me to match pollution data to this location data and identify the correlation between the two. I will use the [WHO data](https://www.who.int/data/gho/data/themes/topics/topic-details/GHO/ambient-air-pollution) to visualize the negative health effects related to exposure to air pollution.

# Method and Medium
To complete this project, I will first storyboard in depth within the project structure I outlined above. Using this as a guideline, I will then clean my selected datasets in order to include the data that I'm interested in using for my project. For example, since I want to show air pollution rates for Black and white communities in Allegheny County I may end up comparing just two areas and removing extraneous information for ease of analysis.

To create my visualizations I will probably end up using Flourish as this has been my favorite data visualization tool thus far, although this may change according to the realities of my datasets and what I'm trying accomplish with them. Tableau is another potential tool that will be used during my project.

My final project will most likely be completed using Shorthand, since this platform seems particularly clean and effective to build a story like this. I would also consider using Esri's Story Maps, as this is another digital platform that would lend itself well to geographic storytelling. Most importantly, neither potential medium will result in a deliverable that requires Powerpoint slides or a pitch deck.
