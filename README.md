This is my public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data at CMU, Fall 2021.

# About me
Hi! My name is Anne (she/her) and I'm a second-year graduate student at CMU studying public policy and management. My areas of interest include social and environmental policy, especially at the intersection of race and environmental justice. 

Before coming to Carnegie Mellon, I received my BA in American Studies and Sociology from the University of Virginia. I have some campaign experience, and spent a year working as an AmeriCorps VISTA in the Greater Pittsburgh area. In my free time I enjoy running, hiking, and playing with my Sheltie puppy, Buddy.

# What I hope to learn
I'm excited to come away from this class having acquired the skills and tools necessary to simplify complicated data sets and convey a narrative using that data. I've found that being able to communicate data in a clear and meaningful is an incredibly important skill, and I can't wait to feel confident doing so.

After graduation, I plan to work as a policy researcher/analyst where I will continue to tell good stories with data.
