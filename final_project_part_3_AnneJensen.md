# Final Project: Part III
## Project Summary
### Overview:
[This project discusses air quality in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania in that the effects of air pollution are concentrated in state-designated environmental justice tracts where the 20% of the population is under the poverty line and/or 30% of the population is non-white minority. With this reality in mind, this project includes a call to action for concerned residents and provides resources to help make a change.

### Outline:
1. Introduce topic and highlight regional disparities in air pollution levels
2. Call attention to conflict through visualizations highlighting disparate health outcomes for Mon Valley residents
3. Resolve story by calling on audience to organize for change and equity in the environment

### Data: 
My data will come from a variety of sources, including the Western Pennsylvania Regional Data Ceter (WPRDC), the United states Census Bureau, and the World Health Organization (WHO). I intend to use this data to create my visualizations, which I sketched out above. I will focus on using data that can show the problem I'm describing (the higher rates of air pollution experienced by Black communities compared to white communities) and the results of this problem (the increased likelihood of illness that comes from long-term exposure to air pollution).

Census Bureau data will inform my understanding of the geographic locations of predominately white and Black areas of Allegheny County, while the WPRDC data will allow me to match pollution data to this location data and identify the correlation between the two. I will use the WHO data to visualize the negative health effects related to exposure to air pollution.]

### Intended Audience:
The intended audience for this project remains residents of Allegheny County who want to learn more about air pollution in their community and get involved in the work to reduce the amount of harmful pollution in the air. This project focuses on the Mon Valley region of Allegheny County as it is home to Clairton Coke Works, a long-time producer of toxic chemicals, but the final data story should be applicable to any community members inspired by the demonstrated inequities between environmental justice areas and non-environmental justice areas. The user research interviews I conducted in Part II of this project highlighted the fact that my interviewees were interested in the material, but felt that only those individuals with prior knowledge of Allegheny County and/or interest in environmental justice topics would resonate with the data story. 

To make my project more accessible and to avoid presenting merely a high-level overview of the data, I sought to tailor my message in a way that personalized the narrative. I expanded my section on the Mon Valley to include more information about the real health effects of air pollution on residents there, and highlighted some of the underlying reasons for these disparities in health outcomes. In discussing the "Toxic Ten" and the fact that four of these 10 facilities are located in the Mon Valley, I worked to provide my audience context for the disparities and a sense that action is needed to curb the pollution output from these facilities. 

### Work Summary:
Although my topic never changed, every step of this project expanded and reshaped the data story that I ultimately produced. In Parts I and II, I struggled somewhat with crafting a coherent and complete narrative that told the story that I wanted to tell. I found it difficult to tailor my message to my audience in a way that avoided just presenting the data. Even though I created storyboards and crafted wireframes of my visualizations in the early stages of this project, I feel like my complete narrative did not come together until I began using Shorthand. 

Another thing that I struggled with was actually creating my visualizations. There is so much air quality data available for Allegheny County, but it is not always easy to create clear, concise visualizations using the available datasets. Then, creating some of the visualizations essential to my final narrative required scraping data from journals and new sites not originally presented in tables, a new experience for me. I did enjoy creating simple maps using ArcGIS Online, and would love to perform more in-depth analyses using this tool in the future. Ultimately, this design process helped me understand the complexities of telling a story with data, particularly when you must locate and visualize that data yourself in a way that best supports the narrative you are trying to convey.
