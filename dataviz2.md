# Assignment: Visualizing Government Debt
## OECD Visualization

## Flourish Visualization
This visualization uses the same data used in the chart above but in a grid of line charts that allows for easy comparisons of debt ratios across a number of countries and among multiple years, from 1995 to 2019.

## Flourish Visualization, Take Two
This visualization builds on the data used throughout this assignment by constructing a graph that attempts to incorporate learned lessons in color, clarity, and chart selection.

This chart specifically highlights the OCED yearly average and data for the United States to display information that may be of importance to an American audience. The time-lapsed visualization shows that the American debt-to-GDP ratio increases rapidly after 2007 (in response to the 2008 Financial Crisis) but stays only slightly above the OCED average over time.

## Discussion
These three data visualizations are built from OECD data are display general government debt as a percentage of total debt. The first visualization is a simple horizontal bar chart derived directly from the OECD's website. It includes only data from 2017 in an attempt to capture a sizable number of countries and their corresponding data. 

The second visualization used Flourish to create a grid of line charts to easily compare the trajectory of debt-to-GDP ratios for countries over time. The charts minimize color used for increased clarity and only include data from 1995 to 2019 since data is not available for all years for all countries. 

The third visualization in this series attempts to display the same data from the grid of line charts in a slightly different way, while still maintaining clarity through color and chart selection. To accomplish these goals, I chose a scatter plot template in which the size of the dots increases according to the total as a percentage of GDP for each country. While it can be difficult for an audience to make size comparisons on a chart, this interpretation is enhanced by the labelled axes and dots. I also changed the color of the dots to bring attention to the OECD data points (black) and the USA data points (green). This chart is also notable for its year indicator slider, which allows the user to easily select a year of data to view or animate and compare across multiple years. In general, I think this visualization does a good job of displaying the data in an understandable and interpretable way. One drawback of this format is that it is slightly less effective at displaying trends in debt over time than the grid of line charts, since the grid displays each country as a stand-alone chart. Likewise, the scatter plot can unintentionally emphasize missing data points, as not every country on the x-axis has a corresponding point for every year. I do think that this second Flourish chart does a better job of displaying the data than the OECD's default chart, however, because it is clearly labelled and  manipulable for easy user interpretation.
